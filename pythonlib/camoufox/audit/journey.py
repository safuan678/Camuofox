"""
Human-like visitor journeys.

A visitor is not a single request. It is an arrival, a period of attention, some
interaction, and a departure. Behavioral defenses score exactly that shape: a
client that requests one page and vanishes is not behaving like a reader, and a
client that requests every page in a fixed order and fixed interval is behaving
like a crawler.

Everything here is randomized on purpose, and drawn from distributions that
resemble real attention rather than a uniform range. Uniform dwell time is the
tell: real reading time is right-skewed, with most visits short and a long tail.
