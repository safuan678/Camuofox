"""
Identify a WAF / bot-defense product and classify its response to a request.

An audit is only useful if it says *what* the defense did, not merely that a
request failed. "Blocked" and "challenged" call for completely different fixes:
a block means the request never reached the app, a challenge means the defense
was unsure and offered the client a way to prove itself. Reporting them as one
thing ("it failed") hides the finding.

Classification reads three independent sources -- status line, headers, and body
-- because vendors disagree about which one carries the tell. A vendor that
returns 200-with-a-challenge-page is common, so trusting the status code alone
would score a challenge as a successful visit.
