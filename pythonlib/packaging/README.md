# Packaging the Camoufox Manager GUI as a standalone application

This directory builds the Qt GUI (Audit tab included) into a runnable
application, so the person running it does not need Python or pip.

## What you get

| Host | Command | Output |
|------|---------|--------|
| Windows | `packaging\build_windows.bat` | `dist\CamoufoxGUI.exe` |
| Linux | `packaging/build_native.sh` | `dist/CamoufoxGUI` |
| macOS | `packaging/build_native.sh` | `dist/CamoufoxGUI.app` |

The output is a **single file** (a `.app` directory bundle on macOS). There is no
`_internal/` folder to ship alongside it and nothing to unzip: the executable
carries the Qt libraries, the QML tree and the Playwright driver inside itself and
unpacks them to a temporary directory when it starts.

## The one rule: build on the target OS

PyInstaller does not cross-compile. A Linux or macOS machine cannot produce a
Windows `.exe` — the executable has to be assembled where it will run. So:

* for a Windows `.exe`, run `build_windows.bat` **on Windows**;
* for a Linux binary, run `build_native.sh` on Linux;
* for a macOS app, run `build_native.sh` on macOS.

There is no flag that changes this.

## The browser is not bundled

The Camoufox browser is a separate ~470 MB download per platform, fetched at
runtime from GitHub Releases by `camoufox fetch` and stored under the platform
cache directory (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\camoufox` on Windows, `~/.cache/camoufox` on
Linux). It is not in the executable.

That is deliberate. Bundling it would add ~470 MB per supported OS, and it would
break the moment a user moved the file, because the path is recorded at install
time. The first run therefore needs one of:

* the GUI's **Browsers** tab → install a version, or
* `camoufox fetch` from a command line.

The audit performs its first three rungs without any browser, so the app is
usable immediately; only the browser rungs (L1–L6) need it.

## What the spec has to get right

Three things are invisible to PyInstaller's static analysis and must be listed
explicitly. Each one was found by building and running the result, and each
failure looked like something other than its cause.

**1. QML and package data.** The GUI loads its interface by filesystem path:

```python
engine.load(QUrl.fromLocalFile(str(Path(__file__).parent / "qml/main.qml")))
```

A missing `main.qml` gives a process that exits with `-1` and prints nothing. The
spec collects the whole `camoufox` data tree for this.

**2. Data files read at import time by dependencies.** These fail before any of
our code runs, so the traceback points into a third-party package:

| Package | File it needs | Symptom if absent |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|
| `apify_fingerprint_datapoints` | `data/input-network-definition.zip` | `FileNotFoundError` from `browserforge` |
| `language_tags` | `data/json/*.json` | `FileNotFoundError` from `language_tags` |
| `playwright` | `driver/` (Node runtime) | browser never launches |

**3. Qt plugins and QML modules.** `PySide6` loads these dynamically by name, so
none appear as an import. Without them Qt reports that it cannot find the platform
plugin, or the QML engine loads no root object.

`hiddenimports` therefore includes `camoufox.gui` and `camoufox.audit` (both
imported lazily), the Qt modules the QML uses, and `geoip2` (checked at runtime
with `importlib.util.find_spec`).

## Windows notes

* **The `--onefile` layout is used on purpose.** The deliverable is one `.exe` to
  double-click, with no folder to unzip or keep beside it. The trade-off is
  start-up: the bootloader unpacks the payload to a temporary directory on every
  launch, so the first window takes a few seconds longer than a folder build
  would. That is also why the Qt trim matters more here than it would in a folder
  build — anything left in the bundle is written to disk on every single launch.
* **Unsigned executables get flagged.** Windows SmartScreen will warn on first
  run because the binary is not code-signed. Signing needs a certificate; there
  is no way around the warning without one.
* **`console=False`** is set, so no terminal window appears. That also means a
  crash prints nowhere — which is exactly why `camoufox_launcher.py` writes
  `CamoufoxGUI-error.log` next to the executable and shows a dialog.
* **Antivirus false positives** are common with PyInstaller output, and a
  self-extracting single file is a shape they watch for. A code-signing
  certificate is the only reliable fix.

## Building without a local machine: GitHub Actions

`.github/workflows/package-gui.yml` runs on a tag push or on demand, and produces
one file per platform. Nothing needs to be installed locally.

**To build and download the executables:**

1. Repository → **Actions** → **Build desktop app** → **Run workflow**.
2. When it finishes, download from the run's **Artifacts** section:
   `CamoufoxGUI-windows-x64.exe` (one file, no zip), the bare
   `CamoufoxGUI-linux-x64` binary, and `CamoufoxGUI-macos-arm64.zip` — a zip only
   because a macOS `.app` is a directory and has to keep its structure and
   symlinks.

**To publish them as a release:**

```bash
git tag v0.5.6-gui
git push origin v0.5.6-gui
```

The three files are attached to that tag's release automatically. The `release`
job only runs for tags: an artifact from a manual run has no release to attach to.

Prefer the manual run unless you actually want a release. The repository also has
a **Build and Release** workflow that fires on `tags: ["*"]`, so pushing a tag
starts a nine-job browser cross-compilation as well. That is why this workflow
matches only `v*-gui` tags — an ordinary version tag such as `v152.0.4-beta.32`
does not trigger a desktop build. The browser build still fires either way; it is
the tagging, not this workflow, that starts it.

Each archive is built on its own runner (`windows-latest`, `ubuntu-24.04`,
`macos-14`) because of the no-cross-compilation rule above.

### The self-check the pipeline runs

`--self-check` loads the real `main.qml` under Qt's **offscreen** platform and
asserts that a root object appears and that every `auditBackend.…` name the QML
binds to exists on `AuditBackend`:

```bash
./dist/CamoufoxGUI --self-check
cat dist/CamoufoxGUI-selfcheck.log
```

In a single-file build this is the only step that exercises the onefile
extraction itself: the executable has to unpack its payload before the check can
even start, so a broken archive fails here rather than on the user's machine.

A passing run reports how many bindings it resolved:

```
self-check OK: QML main.qml, 1 root object(s), 64 audit bindings resolved
```

The names are read out of the QML rather than kept in a list here, because a
hand-maintained list only covers what someone remembered to add — and the failure
this guards against is the binding nobody thought about.

That is what catches a missing `datas` entry. Without it, a bad bundle presents as
a window that never opens, with nothing in any log. The verdict goes to a file
because a `console=False` build has no stderr to print to.

The pipeline then reads the executable's own archive (`pyi-archive_viewer`) and
checks the shipped files by name — `main.qml`, the icon, `browserforge.yml`,
`language_tags`, the apify fingerprint archive, Playwright's Node driver, and the
Qt platform plugin — so a failure names the file that went missing rather than
just reporting a dead app. A single-file build has no `_internal/` folder to look
inside, so the payload is read out of the binary; that is also the stronger check,
because it inspects what the bootloader will extract rather than what happened to
be sitting next to it.

On Windows the log is written before the process exits, so the gate reads the log
rather than the exit code. A GUI-subsystem executable is not waited for by
PowerShell, which makes the exit code unreliable there.

macOS is the exception: its runners have no window server and the PySide6 wheel
has no offscreen plugin there, so that leg verifies the bundle by its data files
and executable instead.

## Testing a build

```bat
REM The launcher writes this only when startup failed:
type dist\CamoufoxGUI-error.log
```

A clean start leaves no such file. Then confirm the Audit tab appears and the
**PROXY** section is reachable by scrolling within the form — it sits below the
Traffic Plan block, not at the top.

For a headless Linux check:

```bash
xvfb-run -s "-screen 0 1440x900x24" dist/CamoufoxGUI
```

## Update this when the GUI changes

If the QML gains an import, or a new dependency is added that reads a data file at
import time, add it to `hook-camoufox.py` and `camoufox-gui.spec`. The failure mode
is a missing-files error from a library you never called directly, which is easy
to misdiagnose as a bug in that library.
