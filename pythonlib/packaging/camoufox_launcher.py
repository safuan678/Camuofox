Frozen-app entry point: open the Camoufox Manager GUI.

`camoufox.__main__:cli` is the CLI group, which prints usage and exits when run
with no arguments -- wrong behaviour for a double-clicked exe. This calls the GUI
directly instead.

When the GUI cannot start (no PySide6, no display), the failure is written to a
log file next to the executable and shown in a message box, because a windowed
build has no console for a traceback to land in.
