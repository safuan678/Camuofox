"""
PyInstaller spec for the Camoufox Manager GUI (Audit tab included).

Build (from the repository root, with the package installed into the build env):

    pyinstaller pythonlib/packaging/camoufox-gui.spec --noconfirm

Output: a single self-contained executable, no folder and no zip.

    dist/CamoufoxGUI.exe                  (Windows)
    dist/CamoufoxGUI                     (Linux)
    dist/CamoufoxGUI.app                 (macOS)

`--onefile` is the deliberate choice here: the deliverable is one file the user
double-clicks, with nothing to unzip and no `_internal/` tree to keep beside it.

The cost is real and worth naming. Every launch unpacks the whole bundle to a
temporary directory and re-extracts it again on the next run, so start-up is
slower than a folder build and the disk sees the full payload each time. That is
exactly why the trim below is not optional in this layout -- the 85 MB of Qt dev
tooling, dead WebEngine locales and build metadata that `_qt_trim` removes would
otherwise be written to disk on every single launch. The payload is kept as small
as the app can honestly run on, and `--self-check` proves the extraction still
produces a working window before the artifact is published.

What is deliberately NOT bundled:

* the Camoufox browser itself (~470 MB per platform). It is fetched on first use
  by the GUI's own Browsers tab, and it is platform-specific, so bundling it
  would triple the download and still break if the user moved the file.
