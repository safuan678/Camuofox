# WAF Audit Console

A hosted front end for the [`camoufox.audit`](../../pythonlib/camoufox/audit)
engine. It answers one question for a site owner:

> As a client looks less and less like a bot, which of my defenses is the one
> actually holding?

It runs the engine's ordered evasion ladder against a target and reports which
rung the defense first stopped, and which rungs sailed through — so a finding
points at a single control instead of "turn everything up".

This is an **attribution** tool. It tells you which control is doing the work. It
is not a bypass bot, and it will not try to defeat a defense you did not ask it to
test.

## Run it

Nothing to install. The engine is vendored into `console/_engine/` and the HTTP
surface is stdlib `http.server`, so the console runs on any Python 3.10+:

```bash
python3 apps/audit-console/app.py
```

It starts a demo WAF of its own, binds a port, and prints the URL. Open it, pick a
visitor count, press Start, and watch the ladder climb. Every run is exportable as
JSON, CSV, HTML, or text.

Useful flags:

| Flag | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `--host` / `--port` | Where to bind (default `127.0.0.1:8000`, loopback only) |
| `--auth-token TOKEN` | Require a bearer token on every API route; required to bind an exposed address |
| `--origin URL` | An origin allowed to POST (repeatable); defaults to same-origin |
| `--target URL --i-am-authorized` | Audit your own host instead of the demo |
| `--export DIR` | Run one audit headlessly, write every report format, exit |
| `--self-test` | Audit the demo at L0 in-process; nonzero exit on failure |

## One-file build

```bash
python3 apps/audit-console/build.py --out dist/waf-audit-console.pyz
python3 dist/waf-audit-console.pyz
```

The `.pyz` is the deliverable: the console, the engine, and the UI in one runnable
file. CI builds and self-tests it on every run, and asserts the archive carries no
third-party packages — if it did, it would no longer run on a bare Python, which is
the one thing it promises.

## Hosting it

The console **binds loopback by default**. That is the secure default: a console
on a laptop is reachable by the person at the laptop and by nobody else, with no
configuration. Exposing it is a deliberate act with a deliberate cost.

To serve it to a network, name an interface *and* a token:

```bash
python3 app.py --host 0.0.0.0 --auth-token "$(python3 -c 'import secrets;print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))')"
```

The console **refuses to start** if you bind a non-loopback address without
`--auth-token` — it exits 2 with an explanation rather than starting exposed and
trusting you to have read this file. With a token set, every API route requires
`Authorization: Bearer <token>`; the UI prompts for it once and keeps it in
`sessionStorage`, never in a URL, so it stays out of access logs and history. The
two health endpoints stay open, because a probe cannot present a credential.

**It only audits its own demo target.** The target host is checked against an
allow-list *before any request leaves*, and the check raises rather than returning
a flag — there is no code path that reaches a socket without passing it. A stranger
who finds the URL cannot point it at a third party, at an internal address, or at
the cloud metadata endpoint; those are all refused with a 403, and no packet is
sent.

To audit a real host, add it deliberately:

```bash
python3 app.py --target https://staging.example.com/ --i-am-authorized
```

`--i-am-authorized` is an explicit acknowledgment that you own the host or have
written permission to test it. Nothing else adds a host to the allow-list.

Other limits, all enforced server-side:

- Request bodies are capped at 64 KiB.
- Visitor count and ladder depth are capped regardless of what the request asks.
- The engine's own ceilings (`max_requests`, `max_rps`, `max_concurrency`) abort
  the run rather than merely advising; a run that hits one records why.
- Proxy passwords are redacted before they can reach a report or a log.
- **Audits are capped across the service, not just within one.** A shared
  admission limit (3 by default) bounds how many audits run at once, so a burst of
  requests cannot multiply the visitor count; a request that finds no slot is
  refused with a 503 and a `Retry-After` rather than queued forever.
- **Cross-origin POSTs are refused.** A browser cannot forge `Origin`, so a page
  on another site cannot drive the console from a visitor's browser. A request
  with no `Origin` (curl, a script) is governed by the token and the bind instead.
- **The routes that cost something are rate-limited per IP** — starting an audit
  and setting a proxy pool, 30 per minute each. Read-only polling is deliberately
  unlimited, so watching a running audit is never penalised.

### Running behind a proxy or orchestrator

The console is **single-process by design**: sessions live in memory, so two
workers behind a load balancer would have disjoint stores and a poll for an id
created on the other worker would 404. Run one worker.

Use `/api/health` for liveness and `/api/health/ready` for readiness. Readiness
answers 503 with a named blocker — "all 3 audit slots are in use", "no demo target
and no allow-list" — when the console is up but cannot accept work. Probing only
liveness routes traffic to a full console and turns saturation into a wave of 503s
that read like a bug. If TLS terminates upstream under another name, pass
`--origin https://console.example.com` so the same-origin check accepts it.

The UI is served from the same origin and resolves through a single asset reader
that accepts only a bare filename, so a path-traversal request cannot read the
filesystem.

## The ladder

Each rung is a client posture, and each says what it isolates over the one below:

| Rung | Posture | What it isolates |
| --- | --- | --- |
| L0 | Naive HTTP | The baseline: does the defense stop a plain client at all? |
| L1 | Headless browser | Whether a real browser engine alone is enough |
| L2 | Consistent headers | Whether header/UA coherence is being checked |
| L3 | Fingerprint masking | Whether canvas/WebGL/audio spoofing matters |
| L4 | Proxy rotation | Whether the exit IP is the signal |
| L5 | Behaviors | Whether mouse/scroll/timing humanization matters |
| L6 | Persistent session | Whether cookies and history are being scored |

A rung that reaches the site cleanly tells you the defenses do not filter at or
below it. The *first* rung that gets stopped is the one worth reading.

That reading only exists relative to the rungs below it, so the console also
offers **Single rung only**: run just the selected rung, with the visitor count
pinned to 100, to repeat one measurement and compare it over time. A single-rung
run says in its own findings that it cannot attribute a defense. Asking for one
rung the host cannot reach — L4+ with no pool, or L1+ with no browser — is
refused rather than pruned to nothing.

Levels 1 and up launch a real Camoufox. On a host with no browser and no
`camoufox` package installed — the normal state for the hosted build — the console
caps the ladder at L0 and records a notice saying so, rather than accepting a
deeper ladder and then reporting a launch failure for every rung.

## Vendored engine

`console/_engine/` is generated by `sync_engine.py` from
`pythonlib/camoufox/audit/`. Do not edit it; edit the source and re-run:

```bash
python3 apps/audit-console/sync_engine.py          # regenerate
python3 apps/audit-console/sync_engine.py --check   # assert no drift
```

The copies are verbatim except for the engine's lazy imports into the rest of the
package (`..async_api`, `..proxy`), which are rewritten to the absolute
`camoufox.*` package: after relocation `..` no longer means `camoufox`. Those
imports only happen inside the browser rungs, so L0 stays dependency-free.

CI checks for drift, so a change to the ladder or the classifier that was not
synced cannot ship an old engine under a new version.

## Tests

```bash
python3 -m pytest apps/audit-console/tests -q   # or: make console-check
python3 -m ci.run_console                       # or: make console
```

The suite drives the console through its real HTTP surface against the real demo
WAF. No mocks and no internet — most of the tests exist to prove the console
*refuses* the wrong things, and a mocked transport would not prove the refusal
happens before a request leaves. It is browser-free, so it runs in the same cheap
CI tier as `pythonlib`.
