"""
Running audits for the console: one session per request, streamed as it happens.

An audit is slow by design -- arrivals are spread over a window rather than fired at
once -- so the console cannot answer with a single blocking response. Each session
owns a thread running its own event loop, appends progress events as the runner
emits them, and keeps the finished report for export.

The scope gate is the important part. This console can be hosted, and a hosted
console that will audit any URL it is handed is an open request forwarder: anyone
could point it at a third party and use it to send traffic from our address. So the
session is constructed with an explicit allow-list of hosts, and any target not in
it is refused before a single request leaves. The hosted build passes only its own
demo WAF; a local operator can pass their own hosts deliberately.
