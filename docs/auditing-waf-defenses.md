# Auditing your own WAF and bot defenses

This guide covers the audit tool added in this fork. It is for testing a site you
own or have written permission to test, to find out which of your defenses are
actually doing work and which are not.

**Read this first.** Running this tool sends real traffic to a real site. It has
safety ceilings and an authorization gate built in, but the responsibility for
having permission is yours. Do not point it at a site you do not control.

## What it answers

Most defenses are tested with a single pass/fail: either the bot got in or it did
not. That result is not actionable. It tells you to turn everything up, which is
how a site ends up with a WAF that blocks real customers.

This tool instead runs an ordered ladder of client postures and reports **which
rung your defenses first stop**, and **which rungs sail through**. Each finding
points at one control, so you know what to fix.

## The evasion ladder

Each rung adds exactly one capability over the one below it, so a change in
outcome between two rungs isolates the defense responsible.

| Level | Posture | What a stop here tells you |
|-------|---------|----------------------------|
| 0 | Plain HTTP, default library User-Agent | Your defenses stop trivial scrapers. This is the floor, not an achievement. |
| 1 | Real Camoufox browser, headless, default fingerprint | You are catching headless/automation tells, not fingerprint spoofing. |
| 2 | Headful browser, coherent navigation headers | You key on missing or contradictory headers. |
| 3 | Consistent fingerprint (screen, locale, timezone, WebGL) | You key on fingerprint inconsistency. |
| 4 | Proxy rotation, one exit IP per visit | Your IP-based reputation or rate limiting is the control doing the work. |
| 5 | Human-like behavior (dwell, mouse, referers) | Your behavioral analysis is the control doing the work. |
| 6 | Persistent identity across visits | You are correlating identity over time. |

Run `camoufox audit levels` to see the current ladder.

## Command line

The fastest path is the CLI.

```bash
# See what the ladder tests
camoufox audit levels

# A first look: 100 visitors over one hour, levels 0-3
camoufox audit run \
    --target https://staging.example.com/ \
    --i-am-authorized

# The full 24-hour picture: 1000 visitors spread across a day
camoufox audit run \
    --target https://example.com/ \
    --i-am-authorized \
    --visitors 1000 --hours 24

# Climb further, with proxy rotation
camoufox audit run \
    --target https://example.com/ \
    --i-am-authorized \
    --max-level 5 \
    --proxy-file proxies.txt \
    --out ./audit-2026-09-15
```

`--i-am-authorized` is required. Without it the tool refuses to start.

Useful flags:

| Flag | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `--visitors N` | How many visitors to schedule. |
| `--hours H` | Window to spread them across. |
| `--pattern` | `human_diurnal` (default), `constant`, `ramp`, `spike`, `sustained`. |
| `--max-level N` | Highest rung to climb, 0-6. |
| `--level N` | Run exactly these rungs (repeatable). |
| `--single-level N` | Run only rung N, skipping L0 up to it. Pins `--visitors` to 100. |
| `--proxy-file` | Text file of proxies, one per line, rotated one per visit. |
| `--proxy-gateway` | Rotating gateway URL; `{session}` is substituted per visit. |
| `--max-requests`, `--max-rps`, `--max-concurrency`, `--max-per-minute` | Safety ceilings. |
| `--seed N` | Makes the schedule and behavior reproducible. |
| `--out DIR` | Write JSON, CSV, HTML and text reports. |

### Why 1000 visitors over 24 hours does not arrive at once

This matters, so it is worth being explicit. The tool does **not** fire N requests
simultaneously, and it does not use a fixed interval either. Both of those patterns
are trivially detectable.

Instead it samples arrival times from a distribution. With the default
`human_diurnal` pattern, arrivals follow a day curve — quiet overnight, busier in
the evening — with random jitter on each one. A 1000-visitor/24-hour run produces
inter-arrival gaps ranging from about 1 second to over 20 minutes, with hundreds of
distinct values. The GUI shows a preview of this before you start, so the shape is
visible rather than assumed.

The `--max-per-minute` ceiling bounds the worst burst, so a random draw cannot
accidentally turn into a flood.

### Running one rung on its own

By default the audit climbs the ladder from L0 up to `--max-level`, because the
finding that matters is *which* rung the defenses stop at. That attribution only
exists relative to the rungs below it: "the defenses first hold at L3" means L3
was stopped and L0-L2 were not.

`--single-level N` runs only rung N, skipping L0 up to it. Use it when you already
know which posture you care about and want to repeat one measurement — a specific
page behind a proxy pool, a change to a WAF rule, the same rung at two points in
time. The visitor count is pinned to 100 in this mode, not taken from `--visitors`,
so two single-rung runs are directly comparable.

A single rung has nothing below it to compare against, so the report says so
rather than printing the usual "first holding rung" line:

```
camoufox audit run \
    --target https://example.com/ \
    --i-am-authorized \
    --single-level 5 --proxy-file proxies.txt
```

```
Single-rung run: only L5 - Human behavior was tested, so this measures one
posture and cannot attribute a defense. Run the ladder from L0 to find which
control is doing the work.
```

`--single-level` cannot be combined with `--level`; both name the rungs to run,
and passing both is refused rather than silently resolved.

## The GUI

Launch it with:

```bash
camoufox gui
```

The **Audit** tab has three parts.

**Left column — configuration.**

- Target URL and authorized hosts. The scope defaults to the target's host, and
  subdomains are opt-in: a bare domain does not authorize `*.domain.com`.
- The authorization checkbox and an optional ticket reference. The Start button
  stays disabled until this is checked.
- Traffic plan: visitor count, window in hours, arrival pattern, and the maximum
  evasion level. Tick **Single-level mode** to run one rung on its own instead of
  the ladder, and pick which one; the visitor count is pinned to 100 and the
  input is disabled, so repeat runs at that rung are comparable.
- An arrival preview chart showing how the visitors are distributed across the
  window, with the busiest and quietest periods called out.
- Proxy settings: no proxy, a list file, or a rotating gateway, with a per-proxy
  ceiling and a **Check** button that parses the file and reports what was usable.
- Safety ceilings: requests, requests per second, concurrency, arrivals per
  minute, and where to write reports.

**Right side — run and results.**

- Start, Stop and Clear. Stop takes effect between visits and lets in-flight
  requests finish, so a run does not end mid-navigation.
- A live table of every visit with its level, verdict, HTTP status and reason.
- The findings list, which is the part to read.
- A running log.

### Proxies

Proxy passwords are never displayed. The Check button shows redacted endpoints
(`http://user:***@1.2.3.4:8080`) so a screenshot of the app does not leak your
pool's credentials.

A malformed line is reported as an error rather than silently skipped. That is
deliberate: a silently dropped proxy means a visit goes out from your own IP under
a foreign fingerprint, which contaminates the audit and can burn the identity.

## Reading the results

The report leads with findings, not totals. A few examples of what they mean:

**"The defenses first hold at L2 - Consistent headers (94% of visits stopped
there)."** Your header validation is doing the work. The fingerprint and IP
layers below it are not being reached. Start by checking that the fingerprints
are actually being applied.

**"L0 and L1 were fully defeated and are doing no work against this client."**
You are spending effort on a layer that this class of bot walks through.

**"L4 reached the site cleanly on 97% of visits."** Proxy rotation defeats your
current control. If that is a surprise, your IP reputation feed is probably not
connected to the edge that serves this route.

**"No known WAF or bot-defense product signature appeared in any response."**
Either the responses carry no identifying headers, or your traffic never reached
a product that would recognize it. Confirm which before trusting an "allowed".

**"340 of 500 visits ended in a transport error."** Connectivity or proxy trouble,
not a defense verdict. Detection rates from that run are not meaningful.

### Verdicts

| Verdict | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| `allowed` | The request reached the site. This is a bypass. |
| `challenged` | A challenge or interstitial was served. The request did not reach the site. |
| `rate_limited` | Refused with a retry horizon (429/503, usually with `Retry-After`). |
| `blocked` | Refused outright (403, or a WAF block page). |
| `error` | Transport or server failure. Not a verdict about the client. |

`challenged` and `blocked` are deliberately distinct. A block means the request
never had a chance; a challenge means the defense is willing to be convinced. They
call for opposite responses, so the tool does not merge them.

## Reports

`--out DIR` (or the report directory in the GUI) writes four files:

- `audit.json` — everything, including per-visit detail.
- `audit.csv` — one row per visit, for a spreadsheet.
- `audit.html` — a self-contained report with no external assets, safe to hand to
  someone who does not have this package installed.
- `audit.txt` — the plain-text summary.

Re-render a saved run with:

```bash
camoufox audit report audit.json
```

## Safety ceilings

The ceilings are not advisory. When one is reached the run stops and the report
records why, rather than continuing quietly.

| Ceiling | Stops the run at |
|---------|------------------|
| `max_requests` | Total requests sent. |
| `max_rps` | Requests per second. |
| `max_concurrency` | Visitors in flight at once. |
| `max_arrivals_per_minute` | Worst-case burst. |
| `max_per_proxy` | Requests through one exit IP. |
| consecutive errors | 15 errors in a row, which usually means the target is down. |

An aborted run is marked as such in the report. Partial levels are labeled, so you
do not mistake a cut-off run for a clean result.

## What this tool will not do

It does not solve CAPTCHAs, exploit vulnerabilities, or replay stolen credentials.
Detecting that a challenge was issued *is* the finding. Solving it would defeat the
defense you are trying to measure, and you would learn nothing about your own site.

## Scope and authorization

- A target must be named in the scope **and** acknowledged. There is no bypass flag.
- Scope matching is exact host plus explicitly listed subdomains. `example.com`
  does not authorize `api.example.com`, and `evil-example.com` is never matched.
- Every navigation passes the scope check, so a redirect or an off-site link cannot
  pull the audit somewhere it was not authorized to go.
- Only `http` and `https` targets are accepted.

## Troubleshooting

**"Refusing to run: pass --i-am-authorized"** — this is the gate working. Confirm
you have permission and pass the flag.

**Browser levels report `CamoufoxNotInstalled`** — the browser binary has not been
fetched yet. Run `camoufox fetch`, or use the Browsers tab in the GUI.

**Headed levels (L2 and above) report an error about `no DISPLAY`** — this should not
happen on its own. The runner detects a host with no X server and points those rungs
at Camoufox's built-in virtual display, announcing it with a notice in the log. If you
see a raw `no DISPLAY environment variable specified` in a visit reason instead, the
virtual display could not start: check that `Xvfb` is installed (`apt install xvfb`),
or run under `xvfb-run`.

Note that a virtual display is not a desktop. Headed levels under it still look like
a real headed browser to JavaScript, but there is no window manager and no real screen
hardware, so a defense that inspects those may behave differently than on a laptop.
Treat an L2+ result from a headless server as strong evidence, not as identical to a
run on a real desktop.

**Headed levels fail with `CannotFindXvfb`** — the fallback above needs `Xvfb` to be
present. `apt install xvfb` (or run the whole audit under `xvfb-run -a`) and the rung
will launch.

**Fingerprint levels (L3 and above) run without geolocation** — the `geoip` extra is
not installed, so `geoip2` is missing and those rungs would otherwise fail to launch.
The runner clears the flag on its own so the rung still runs and reports a verdict,
and logs a notice. The mask is weaker: the spoofed fingerprint is not aligned to the
request's IP location or timezone, which a defense comparing the two can detect.
Install it with `pip install camoufox[geoip]` for the full mask.

**A rotating geoip rung resolves its geography through the proxy** — the rung's
timezone, locale and WebRTC address are taken from the visitor's proxy exit IP, which
is why each visitor at such a rung gets its own browser rather than sharing one: a
shared launch would paint every visitor with the first visitor's geography. A pool
that verifies exit IPs (`verify_ip: true`) lets the launch reuse that already-verified
address; an unverified pool is still resolved through the proxy at launch, just at the
cost of one extra lookup. Both paths keep this host's own IP out of the fingerprint.

Both fallbacks are decisions the runner makes per rung, and both are asserted in
`pythonlib/tests/test_audit.py` against the assembled launch options rather than
against a live visit. That suite runs in CI's browser-free `pythonlib` tier, which
fetches no browser, so a version of these tests that launched one would report
`CamoufoxNotInstalled` as if it were an audit finding.

**Every level reports the same verdict** — check that the target is actually being
reached. A `403` at L0 and a `403` at L6 with an identical body often means the
scope is wrong or the host is refusing all traffic.

**Detection rates look implausible** — check the error count in the findings. A run
where most visits errored is measuring your connectivity, not your defenses.
